## Project 2: Investigate the Dataset of Doctor Appointments

The dataset I am analyzing for this project has recorded information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil. Each medical appointment has 14 associated variables and the most important one is the last variable called No-show which tells if the patients show-up to their appointment. We should be careful with this column, since it says "No" if the patient showed up to their appointment, and "Yes" if they didn't. Most variable names are quite self-explanatory. Particular explanations are provided:

1) "ScheduledDay" tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
2) "Neighborhood" indicates the location of the hospital.
3) "Scholarship" indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia. For more information, please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia 
4) "SMS_received" tells us if a patient gets a message reminder about the schedule appointments or not

The main purpose of my analysis is to identify among these associated variables, what factors are important for  us to know in order to predict whether a patient will show up for the scheduled appointment.

##  Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

This project will assure I have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons. 

### Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#intro)
- [Part I - Probability](#probability)
- [Part II - A/B Test](#ab_test)
- [Part III - Regression](#regression)


A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

##  Project 4: Wrangle, Analyze and Visualize Tweet Archive of Twitter User WeRateDogs

This project has two parts. Firstly, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. 

After gather and clean WeRateDogs Twitter data, I have then obtained a well structured DataFrame containing basic tweet data for 1870 records of their original tweets with dog pictures. Four interesting insights have been produced by analyzing above information.
