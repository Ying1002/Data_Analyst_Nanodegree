## Project 1:Investigate the Dataset of Doctor Appointments

 **The dataset I am analyzing for this project has recorded information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil. Each medical appointment has 14 associated variables and the most important one is the last variable called No-show which tells if the patients show-up to their appointment. We should be careful with this column, since it says "No" if the patient showed up to their appointment, and "Yes" if they didn't. Most variable names are quite self-explanatory. Particular explanations are provided:**

1) "ScheduledDay" tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
2) "Neighborhood" indicates the location of the hospital.
3) "Scholarship" indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia. For more information, please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia 4) "SMS_received" tells us if a patient gets a message reminder about the schedule appointments or not

 **The main purpose of my analysis is to identify among these associated variables, what factors are important for 
us to know in order to predict whether a patient will show up for the scheduled appointment.**
